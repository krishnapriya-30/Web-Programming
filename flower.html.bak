<h1><b><u>Flowers</h1></b></u>
<p>Flowers, also known as blossoms and blooms, are the reproductive structures of flowering plants. 
Typically, they are structured in four circular levels around the end of a stalk. 
These include: sepals, which are modified leaves that support the flower; petals,
 often designed to attract pollinators; male stamens, where pollen is presented; and female gynoecia, 
 where pollen is received and its movement is facilitated to the egg. When flowers are arranged in a group, 
 they are known collectively as an inflorescence.</p>
